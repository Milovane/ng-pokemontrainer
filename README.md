## Pokémon trainer

# Authors: Milovan Glisovic & Jetro Saarti
In this webapplication the user can look through a pokemon catalogue and catch Pokémon.
The user needs to login on the application to be able to access these features. This can be done either by loggin in to an existing user or creating a new one. After the user has logged in they will then be redirected to the catalogue page. When pressing the pokéballs on the different pokémons in the catalogue the user will add ("catch") them to their trainer page, in the trainer page the user is able to see all added pokemon. If the user wants to remove a added pokemon they simply have to press the same button again, which will then return the icon back into a pokéball.
