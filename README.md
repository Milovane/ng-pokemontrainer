# Pokémon trainer

## Authors: Milovan Glisovic & Jetro Saarti
In this web application the user can look through a pokemon catalogue and catch Pokémon.
The user needs to login on the application to be able to access these features. This can be done either by logging in to an existing user or creating a new one, done by simply entering a previously created username or a brand new one. After the user has logged in they will then be redirected to the catalogue page.

Catalogue lists the pokemons fetched from Pokeapi (https://pokeapi.co/). The user can add ("catch") any of the listed pokemons to his/her inventory by pressing a pokéball icon. Pokemons that are already included in the user's inventory are marked with a "gotcha"-icon.

Trainer-page lists the pokemons in the user's inventory. Users can remove a pokemon from their inventory by pressing the "gotcha"-icon, which will then return the icon back into a pokéball.
